# Google-Favicon
A userscript that displays favicons on Google Search.

If you wish to increase the icon size, change the "iconSize" Setting from 16 to 24 inside the script.

Use Tampermonkey or Violentmonkey to install.

NOTE: Google is rolling out support for favicons. This script is no longer required if you got this search update.

Google has not, however, added favicons for Video search. So, you can still use this userscript for Video search. This script will detect existing favicons and prevent them from showing up twice on regular search.
